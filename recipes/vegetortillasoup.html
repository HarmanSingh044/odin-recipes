    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>People have offered me their firstborn children for this recipe; it is simple, easy to make, and delicious. 
       It's also vegan if you don't add the cheese at the end. If you prefer a more spicy soup, add a dash or two of hot sauce before serving.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
       <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>(1 pound) package frozen pepper and onion stir fry mix</li>

        <li>3 tablespoons ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>3 (4 ounce) cans chopped green chile peppers, drained</li>
        <li>(14 ounce) cans vegetable broth</li>
